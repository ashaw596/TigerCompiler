How to use ANTLR from command line:

1) Run Tiger.g using the command: java -jar antlr.jar Tiger.g

2) compile all the java files output by 1) (this assumes you are in Tiger directory):
	on Unix/OSX: javac -cp .:antlr.jar *.java
	on windows: javac -cp .;antlr.jar *.java

3) Running the compiled java:
	on Unix/OSX: java -cp .:antlr.jar ANTLRDemo
	on windows: java -cp .;antlr.jar ANTLRDemo

If all goes well there should be no output to console/terminal. If there is any output during 3) it means there was a parse error. Check your input and try again.
